# Traffic Sign Classification Project

This project aims to classify traffic signs using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The model is trained on the GTSRB dataset, which contains 43 different classes of traffic signs. This project is particularly useful for autonomous vehicles to identify and interpret traffic signs accurately.

## Introduction

Traffic sign classification is a crucial component in the development of autonomous vehicles. It enables the vehicle to understand and obey traffic rules by recognizing various traffic signs in real-time. This project leverages deep learning techniques to achieve high accuracy in traffic sign classification.

## Dataset

The German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset is used for training and testing the model. The dataset contains over 50,000 images of traffic signs categorized into 43 classes.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

- numpy
- pandas
- tensorflow
- keras
- scikit-learn
- opencv-python
- matplotlib

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas tensorflow keras scikit-learn opencv-python matplotlib


**Usage
Data Preprocessing**
First, preprocess the data by running the data_preprocessing.py script. This script loads the images and labels from the GTSRB dataset and applies data augmentation.

python data_preprocessing.py


**Model Training**
Train the model by running the model_training.py script. This script defines and trains a CNN on the preprocessed data.


python model_training.py

**Model Evaluation**
Evaluate the trained model using the model_evaluation.py script. This script loads the test data and computes the model's accuracy.

python model_evaluation.py


**Demo**
Run the demo script demo.py to classify a single image of a traffic sign.

python demo.py

**Model Architecture**
The model used for this project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the following layers:

Conv2D
MaxPooling2D
Flatten
Dense
Dropout
The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function.

**Results**
The model achieves an accuracy of approximately XX% on the test set. [Update this section with your actual results]
